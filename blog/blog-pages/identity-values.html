          <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>

          <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
              <p>At a previous job, I was given a pay rise. My colleague who was higher up the food chain than me asked how much my pay rise was - 
                I was happy to share this with him as I believe transparency around fair pay is important and I believed my new wage reflected my duties. 
                On disclosing my new rate, it was revealed that he was earning less than me despite having more reponsibilites and holding a higher position. 
                When then discussed this with our other colleagues. Before disclosing my new rate I knew my boss would not have been happy for me to share my earnings, 
                but as I susspected, it transpired there seemed to be a few discrepancies throughout the teams wages. 
                I decided it was more important to share this in order to reveal the injustices in pay throughout the company - even at the risk of being persecuted 
                (although legally I couldn't be) for disclosing such information.</p>

              <p>An example where I had to make an ethical decision on behalf of someone else is when my wife was in labour. 
                There was a moment just before our daughter was born where the doctors wanted to give her a procedure that I knew she did not want to have. 
                She had written out her birth preferences ahead of the birth and had clearly stipulated she did not want the procedure unless of an emergency situation. 
                It was not an emergency situation. Birth is a very intense event and things can escalate quickly - especially in a medical environment, 
                with pressures from medical professionals who in that moment feel as thought they sit at the top of the decision hierarchy. 
                At that pivotal point, I had to quickly asses the situation and be the clear headed voice of reason to protect my wife best interests, 
                I decided that I would need to step in and re articulate her preferences calmly but firmly to the doctors. 
                The procedure was not done and the birth of our daughter eventuated perfectly heathy as per my wife's desires.</p>
      
          <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3> 

              <p>Despite what we grow up with, I believe that ultimately a persons values and identity are ever evolving. 
                Sometimes they change for the better, sometimes for worse. I feel that as we age, and with each choice we make, 
                our values either cement themselves or reinvent themselves. I was born in a small town in the Waikato into a religious farming family, 
                my upbringing has heavily influenced my values - in ways I am only just starting to unravel. 
                The repressed nature of our countries emotional literacy - particular amongst men - has also no doubt had large impact of the way I am 
                able to navigate the world. I have always felt in someway like an outsider, having always been drawn to the arts and with a strong pull 
                to travel (specially to not supper normal travel locations) and leave the town I am from - whilst also yearning for the familial closeness we all so desperately need. 
                Being the black sheep has propelled me to seek relationships and experiences that I can relate to and am excited by. 
                I am lucky to have deep connections within my friendships and an unmeasurable love for my wife and daughter. </p>

          <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>

            <p>My biggest strengths and weekness would be my trifector of my key personality traits, 
              that are either operating in perfect harmony or in full force against each other.
              I am stubborn and this can often get the better of me and leave me stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
              On the other hand it also means I am very determined and relentless in my pursuits, once I have put my mind to them. 
              I am fiercely loyal and commited to the ones I love, which makes me a dedicated partner and father but my protective instincts also mean I can be hot headed and impatient when it comes to protecting my people. 
              I am guarded and can be emotionally closed off despite feeling and seeing my own personal growth when I allow myself to be vulnerable.</p> 

          <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
            
            <p>Sometime ago during an art exhibition,  I was having to install a series of large framed photographs high up on a wall for the artist. 
              I wanted to install them correctly as I was my job to do so as the gallery technician. The artist said it would be fine with minimal fixings holding it to the wall, 
              I was apprehensive and tried to push the point that the more secure it was affixed the safer it would be, and that given the size and weight of the work, 
              its potential to cause harm was great. There was a bit of tension in this discussion but after a short coffee and cigarette break we discussed how to approach 
              this issue with the audience safety at heart. I also came up with a hanging solution that wouldn't slow down the install so all parties would be satisfied with the outcome. 
              At the end of the day communicating your thoughts and reasons for doing something will always get the best results. I now have a baby with that said artist.</p>
