          <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
		          <p>My long term goal is being able to work remotely as a developer either for a company or as a 
                freelancer so that my life can both provide and accomodate for my families needs. 
                Prior to joining Dev Academy I was a chef and still have a huge amount on interest in food and wine. 
                In an ideal world I will find a way to marry the new skills I gain from Dev with my existing interest in culinary culture. 
                Being able to have a job that I can do remotely is quite important as I am keen to do some travel over the next few years.
              </p> 

          <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
            <p>I would consider myself a tactile learning, I learn best by doing. 
              I am dyslexic which I see as both a blessing and a curse. 
              On one hand it means I don't learn and absorb information in the ways that the majority of mainstream education is taught, 
              but on the other hand it means the myriad of other ways I learn is quite varied and I believe my dyslexia forces me 
              to challenge my brain in unusual ways - even if that is sometimes to try and assimilate. Philosophically, 
              the way I operate in a kitchen is the same way I feel most professions and projects should be approached. 
              As a cook in a kitchen everyone has individual roles and duties with various professional hierarchies, 
              but all are equally integral to the final output. In order to swim, you must be able to work and communicate as a team, whatever stage of the cook. 
              If one sinks, we all sink.
            </p>

          <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>I'd like to streamline my communication, to be able to present my ideas and thoughts concisely and in a clear way. 
              I'd like to get better at asking for help and understanding my own limitations. I think my dyslexia has programmed me to try and find the loopholes, 
              I feel confident getting stuck into a project and working alone but struggle to seek assistance when it's needed and not just perseverer on throuhg. 
              So I think being able to share the work load in a group setting and clearly communicate when nessasary would be a helpful skill for me to develop. 
              I am constantly thinking about a million different things at once so finding ways to streamline my workflow and focusing on one thing at a time would be an asset to me. 
              I am both a pessimist and a people person, I'd like to be more trusting of others and feel comfortable taking people for their word.</p>

          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
            <p>Like in any instance in life, professional or otherwise I will approach people with respect and with the knowledge that we all likely come from wildly different contexts. 
              I will ensure I am productive in my own learning journey by playing to my strengths whilst being open to learning in all capacities.</p> 

            <p>Firstly, I will try and not get to this point by managing my time thoughtfully and having routines that allow me to rebalance regularly. 
              I have found that the best thing for me to do when I start to feel overwhelmed is find a way to reset which usually involves taking some kind of a break. 
              Going for a run or a game of basketball or even just walking in the fresh air always helps me to clear my head, reset and de stress. 
              Endorphin stimulation is one of my best ways to help with stress and frustration. The other thing that really helps me is to cook food. 
              Going into the kitchen and make something, probably with a glass of wine. What is life for, if not for the simple pleasures.</p>

          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>When needed (and it will be needed!), if I get stuck and can't find a way out, 
                I would seek advice/help form another student (without disrupting their workflow or learning) before approaching a facilitator for assistance. 
                I think seeking help form other students who are also trying to work through the course is a great benefit to doing a course with others.</p>

          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>I think the question has answered itself. I expect the team to facilitate my learning, guiding me to improve where they sit fit but not forcing me into one way or their way of thinking/learning.</p> 

          <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
            <p>As a new father, my daughter comes before anything else, no matter what. Sunday is our day of rest and spent with family. 
              Reserving this time to focus elsewhere will allow me to be fully present with Dev when that's my focus. 
              I should also schedule in some social time with friends, maintaining relationships is important for mental health all round.</p>
