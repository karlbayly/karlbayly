          <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
              The principles of neuroplasticity have far reaching benefits for humanity. It is the ability of our neural pathways in our brain to change through growth & reorganisation. How we learn, and adapt throughout or life, responding to our lived experiences consciously and subconscious. While learning or experiencing new things our brain rewires itself and builds on these new pathways making them stronger the more we activate them. Like learning java script, something new, our brains are reorienting and building stronger connections the more we practice.
            </p> 
            <p>
              I think being actively engaged and using mindfulness within learning along with repetition, practise helps to reap the reward of neuroplasticity.
              Learning to respond to difficult situation, with grace and humility and understanding, that difficult things are just learning and personal growth opportunities.

          <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>
              According to my most recent google search, a growth mindset is the ability to adapt and improve, it see's failure as an opportunity for growth and developing. Enlightenment is for everyone. While I find this concept not new to me, I do think that the application in daily life can be harder to maintain, it takes a fair bit of tenacity. Even if one had a very healthy self belief & self-determination, things can and are hard. I think being forgiving with oneself and understanding ones learning strengths goes a long way, you'll get there, but it can take time, practise and hard work.

          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
              <p>Emotional Intelligence  the perception, use, understand, of our personal emotions.
              </p> 
    
          <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>I would argue that is a quite different from IQ as a persons IQ a.k. 
              human intelligence is a score derived from a set of standardised tests and not everyone test well, but that dose not mean they have a low or high IQ. If you were well equipped with a solid EQ I believe you are better equipped to go thought life than someone with a super high IQ.
            </p>
    
          <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>A persons EQ effects every aspect of life. Each daily interaction with others is reflected in  their EQ , how we react, reflect, engage with other life forms and how we respond to our own needs and others with empathy and kindness. I mean the if everyone interacted well with these 5 elements (Self-awareness, Self-regulation, Social skill , Empathy, Motivation) the world would probably be in better shape.</p>

          <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
		          <p>My long term goal is being able to work remotely as a developer either for a company or as a 
                freelancer so that my life can both provide and accomodate for my families needs. 
                Prior to joining Dev Academy I was a chef and still have a huge amount on interest in food and wine. 
                In an ideal world I will find a way to marry the new skills I gain from Dev with my existing interest in culinary culture. 
                Being able to have a job that I can do remotely is quite important as I am keen to do some travel over the next few years.
              </p> 

          <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
            <p>I would consider myself a tactile learning, I learn best by doing. 
              I am dyslexic which I see as both a blessing and a curse. 
              On one hand it means I don't learn and absorb information in the ways that the majority of mainstream education is taught, 
              but on the other hand it means the myriad of other ways I learn is quite varied and I believe my dyslexia forces me 
              to challenge my brain in unusual ways - even if that is sometimes to try and assimilate. Philosophically, 
              the way I operate in a kitchen is the same way I feel most professions and projects should be approached. 
              As a cook in a kitchen everyone has individual roles and duties with various professional hierarchies, 
              but all are equally integral to the final output. In order to swim, you must be able to work and communicate as a team, whatever stage of the cook. 
              If one sinks, we all sink.
            </p>

          <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>I'd like to streamline my communication, to be able to present my ideas and thoughts concisely and in a clear way. 
              I'd like to get better at asking for help and understanding my own limitations. I think my dyslexia has programmed me to try and find the loopholes, 
              I feel confident getting stuck into a project and working alone but struggle to seek assistance when it's needed and not just perseverer on throuhg. 
              So I think being able to share the work load in a group setting and clearly communicate when nessasary would be a helpful skill for me to develop. 
              I am constantly thinking about a million different things at once so finding ways to streamline my workflow and focusing on one thing at a time would be an asset to me. 
              I am both a pessimist and a people person, I'd like to be more trusting of others and feel comfortable taking people for their word.</p>

          <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
            <p>Like in any instance in life, professional or otherwise I will approach people with respect and with the knowledge that we all likely come from wildly different contexts. 
              I will ensure I am productive in my own learning journey by playing to my strengths whilst being open to learning in all capacities.</p> 

            <p>Firstly, I will try and not get to this point by managing my time thoughtfully and having routines that allow me to rebalance regularly. 
              I have found that the best thing for me to do when I start to feel overwhelmed is find a way to reset which usually involves taking some kind of a break. 
              Going for a run or a game of basketball or even just walking in the fresh air always helps me to clear my head, reset and de stress. 
              Endorphin stimulation is one of my best ways to help with stress and frustration. The other thing that really helps me is to cook food. 
              Going into the kitchen and make something, probably with a glass of wine. What is life for, if not for the simple pleasures.</p>

          <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
            <p>When needed (and it will be needed!), if I get stuck and can't find a way out, 
                I would seek advice/help form another student (without disrupting their workflow or learning) before approaching a facilitator for assistance. 
                I think seeking help form other students who are also trying to work through the course is a great benefit to doing a course with others.</p>

          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
            <p>I think the question has answered itself. I expect the team to facilitate my learning, guiding me to improve where they sit fit but not forcing me into one way or their way of thinking/learning.</p> 

          <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
            <p>As a new father, my daughter comes before anything else, no matter what. Sunday is our day of rest and spent with family. 
              Reserving this time to focus elsewhere will allow me to be fully present with Dev when that's my focus. 
              I should also schedule in some social time with friends, maintaining relationships is important for mental health all round.</p>

<!-- Values & Identity post -->

        <div class="blog">

          <h2 id ="identity-values">Values & Identity</h2>
    

          <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
              <p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=cancer+attributes" target=”_blank”> Google Cancer personality traits.</a></p>

          <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
              <p>At a previous job, I was given a pay rise. My colleague who was higher up the food chain than me asked how much my pay rise was - 
                I was happy to share this with him as I believe transparency around fair pay is important and I believed my new wage reflected my duties. 
                On disclosing my new rate, it was revealed that he was earning less than me despite having more reponsibilites and holding a higher position. 
                When then discussed this with our other colleagues. Before disclosing my new rate I knew my boss would not have been happy for me to share my earnings, 
                but as I susspected, it transpired there seemed to be a few discrepancies throughout the teams wages. 
                I decided it was more important to share this in order to reveal the injustices in pay throughout the company - even at the risk of being persecuted 
                (although legally I couldn't be) for disclosing such information.</p>

              <p>An example where I had to make an ethical decision on behalf of someone else is when my wife was in labour. 
                There was a moment just before our daughter was born where the doctors wanted to give her a procedure that I knew she did not want to have. 
                She had written out her birth preferences ahead of the birth and had clearly stipulated she did not want the procedure unless of an emergency situation. 
                It was not an emergency situation. Birth is a very intense event and things can escalate quickly - especially in a medical environment, 
                with pressures from medical professionals who in that moment feel as thought they sit at the top of the decision hierarchy. 
                At that pivotal point, I had to quickly asses the situation and be the clear headed voice of reason to protect my wife best interests, 
                I decided that I would need to step in and re articulate her preferences calmly but firmly to the doctors. 
                The procedure was not done and the birth of our daughter eventuated perfectly heathy as per my wife's desires.</p>
      
          <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3> 

              <p>Despite what we grow up with, I believe that ultimately a persons values and identity are ever evolving. 
                Sometimes they change for the better, sometimes for worse. I feel that as we age, and with each choice we make, 
                our values either cement themselves or reinvent themselves. I was born in a small town in the Waikato into a religious farming family, 
                my upbringing has heavily influenced my values - in ways I am only just starting to unravel. 
                The repressed nature of our countries emotional literacy - particular amongst men - has also no doubt had large impact of the way I am 
                able to navigate the world. I have always felt in someway like an outsider, having always been drawn to the arts and with a strong pull 
                to travel (specially to not supper normal travel locations) and leave the town I am from - whilst also yearning for the familial closeness we all so desperately need. 
                Being the black sheep has propelled me to seek relationships and experiences that I can relate to and am excited by. 
                I am lucky to have deep connections within my friendships and an unmeasurable love for my wife and daughter. </p>

          <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>

            <p>My biggest strengths and weekness would be my trifector of my key personality traits, 
              that are either operating in perfect harmony or in full force against each other.
              I am stubborn and this can often get the better of me and leave me stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
              On the other hand it also means I am very determined and relentless in my pursuits, once I have put my mind to them. 
              I am fiercely loyal and commited to the ones I love, which makes me a dedicated partner and father but my protective instincts also mean I can be hot headed and impatient when it comes to protecting my people. 
              I am guarded and can be emotionally closed off despite feeling and seeing my own personal growth when I allow myself to be vulnerable.</p> 

          <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
            
            <p>Sometime ago during an art exhibition,  I was having to install a series of large framed photographs high up on a wall for the artist. 
              I wanted to install them correctly as I was my job to do so as the gallery technician. The artist said it would be fine with minimal fixings holding it to the wall, 
              I was apprehensive and tried to push the point that the more secure it was affixed the safer it would be, and that given the size and weight of the work, 
              its potential to cause harm was great. There was a bit of tension in this discussion but after a short coffee and cigarette break we discussed how to approach 
              this issue with the audience safety at heart. I also came up with a hanging solution that wouldn't slow down the install so all parties would be satisfied with the outcome. 
              At the end of the day communicating your thoughts and reasons for doing something will always get the best results. I now have a baby with that said artist.</p>
